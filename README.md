#### 1.Implement the Machine Leaning KNN and SVM algorithms using Python to classify the hyperspectral remote sensing images over Pavia University
#### 2.Conducted experiments to achieve best results utilizing original spectral features and PCA resulting features 
#### 3.Leaded a parameter sensitivity analysis of each algorithm, followed by a comparison of the classification effectiveness using overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient
